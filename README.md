# AUTOMATIC-NIUMBER-PLATE-DETECTION
This project will detect the number plate of an vehicle using IMAGE SEPERATION and OCR.
 In recent years, automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) or licence plate recognition (LPR) has proven to be one of the most effective methods for vehicle surveillance. It can be used in a variety of public settings for a variety of purposes, including traffic safety enforcement and automatic toll text collecting.
 The four steps of an ANPR algorithm are as follows:
 (1) Image capture of the vehicle
 (2) Number plate detection
 (3) Character segmentation and
 (4) Recognition of characters.
 The first step is to capture the  image of the vehicle looks very easy but it is quite exigent task as it is very difficult to capture the image of a moving vehicle in real time in such a manner that no component of the  vehicle especially license plate should be missed. Presently number plate detection and recognition processing time is less than 50ms  in multiple systems.
 The success of fourth step depends on the efficiency of the both second and third step are able to locate vehicle number plate and separate each character.
 These systems follow different approaches to locate vehicle number plate from vehicle and then to extract vehicle number from that image.
